24,5464,this is my first visit to brand half million in all its branches and unfortunately this is the worst experience i have ever had in my life when i entered the car orders there was nothing clarifying that you can order before you reach the counter and if you reach the counter to order no one will serve you if they expel you they expelled a policeman who was in front of me knowing that the customer is always right after i greeted them and walked away they said what do you want i said cold drip coffee its price is riyals and he gave me a readymade unit that was at the window on the outside and he only gave me a new unit their style of service is extremely despicable as if you are coming to take your requests from his heirs not as if we are a reason for employing him after god as consumers of service i was surprised by the high prices but after learning what the reason was i put a star because the rating is necessary but i dont recommend it at all,price,positive

30,6183,coffee does not need everyone to know the taste of its existence desserts are somewhat limited the sandwiches are beautiful and their variety is wide prices are average and lower the place and branch have a bitter and sweet atmosphere i will definitely visit again,food,positive
30,6184,they have amazing matcha my favorite place is if i want matcha in jeddah brownies that are a little dry are usually better than this their salted caramel is also good spicy drinks i have not tried in this branch the place is beautiful and the service is excellent but i prefer to take my coffee drivethru because the place is often crowded i wish you could add french toast and carrot cake there would be nice options on the menu and good luck,clean,positive
30,6185,the branch is beautiful and god willing the service is fast the coffee is very excellent i love todays coffee and my mother liked the signature bitters of course it is essential that you take delicious minibites with brownies pill after pill is addictive just a simple note i took the mug from them for cold drinks and to be honest it is not good it does not keep cold but it looks nice,ambience,positive
30,6186,i recently visited this coffee joint and i must say their signature coffee is absolutely fantastic every sip was delightful the store itself has a charming ambiance with its modern yet cozy interior design its the perfect spot to relax or catch up with friends over a cup of coffee while their signature coffee exceeded my expectations i have to admit that their matcha drink wasnt quite to my liking the balance of flavors didnt resonate well with my palate however taste preferences can vary from person to person so it might still be worth giving it a try if youre an avid matcha enthusiast overall i highly recommend this coffee joint for its exceptional signature coffees and inviting atmosphere just make sure to explore beyond the matcha options if its not your cup of tea or should i say cup of matcha,dessert,positive

30,6192,because the rain came but because of the balcony unfortunately there are no open rooms suitable for women other than him otherwise i know from the first branch that they do not have anything with the taste of sour coffee a flat white croissant filled with bagel oil with halloumi not the same picture and on top of all that the employees are not allowed to clean unless we are sitting get up and wash the floor options the dessert is limited and tasteless unfortunately,staff,positive
30,6193,cute decor and great prices i ordered a small sweet hot chocolate but be careful if you order a large one that tastes bitter once i ordered a sweet flat white for riyals and it was delicious i ordered a delicious spanish latte with pistachios and the pistachios are clear and i like a clear flavour i expected riyals i ordered two delicious desserts for riyals but i ordered brownie beforehand much i ordered kuanchi coffee ice cream which was also delicious and priced at riyals,ambience,positive
